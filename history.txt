It's hard to interpret
If the voices are friends
Or are they really the culprit

Am I the lighthouse beam cutting through the fog of war
Or am I really the reason that the war has a start

WORD: INTEREST
LYRICS:
Every day i wake up in search for an interest
Looking for a place to put my hope
But never finding a right place to invest

Try to put it into writing
But i'll never be at rest
Every day my thoughts get so loud
But i try not to let
It rain down from it's cloud
Follow the spark of an idea
In a forest full of doubt
Tryna get through the sea
But it's a constant battle throughout
