LYRICS:
Welcome to my intro
Don't know where to begin though
------------------------------
------------------------------
DATE: 28/12/2025
LYRICS:
Step into my mind
It's hard to not get intrigued
Don't know what you mind find
but the pain always sits in it's own league
------------------------------
------------------------------
DATE: 27/12/2025
LYRICS:
My emotions get way too intricate
Can't seem to live with it
It's a maze and the pain gets too intimate 
Makes me stuck in a toxic relationship

It feels good one time
The next it feels like a sentence forcing to rhyme 
While I know that I created my own crime 
And now I'm forced to say "I'm just fine" 
While I keep falling off the line
And I got trapped in the pain 
No way out, but it's also a gain 
The alchemy of turning pain into power
------------------------------

LYRICS:
I'm not looking for just intimacy
I want someone to be part of my legacy
But to do that, love needs to be more than just a fantasy
I need to find a way to connect back to my feelings
While it feels impossible to reach those ceilings
To so I thought

But then I got the spark 
Love wasn't real for years, but I stepped out of that dark
I felt love again, even though I fought against
And look where it got me
It's shown again that it's never meant to be
I'll never be the guy who ends up happy
I got it back, just to ripped off the track 
I mean how stupid am I 
Thinking it got real, but never questioning the "can I"
And it fucked me over, just like always
Someone gave a spark in the dark
Just to leave me another mark

I hate that I let love back in 
Just to think I could possibly win 
Even though I knew that it would be a sin
Against all the things inside my head
I worked to not feel what I just said 
But I ignored that work 
Thinking it would beat the odds and give a perk 
Another big fail, pushing myself again on the rail

Now I need to fight again 
But I'm scared that I never truly can 
Because it came back after years throwing my deck 
And it blew up in my face, like always 
Again losing this race, trapped in a maze

LYRICS:
every therapy feels like an interview
they keep telling me thing I already knew
i know that my good mind is hard to find
that my thoughts get intertwined 
that I could be with hunderds of people
and i'll always be left behind

I feel like I live my life all alone
even with friends, i'm always in a different zone
but maybe i'll get to achieve
everything that I believe
reaching others the way that Nate did with me
but even then
 The roar of the crowd is a lonely sound
when the only voice I hear
is the darkness that I found

it's like my brain is infected 
because of people that neglected
me and everything I knew 
like i'm on my own planet
that no-one ever flew - to
yet they're surprised they never knew what i'd - do
if life was ever too much
if the fight inside ended 'cause I finally gave up
------------------------------

DATE: 24/12/2025
LYRICS:
a path to the good and bad, but i'm stuck at the interval
the good is the best, but bad for my survival
I fought for it though, but bounced back like a basketball 
over and over, now there's no way to sober
up from the bad, it's a part of me that'll last

can't find a way through the sad
so I did what I had
to do
i gave up the fight, and the bad came through
i gave up the light, 'cause the pain is what I knew
and now I'm stuck
fell out of luck

and i'm tryna get some healing, but i'm talking to the ceiling
like he knows what I've been feeling, like he hears what i've been dealing
with 
and he knows what i've been fearing
while he's the one i'm kneeling 
to
now i sit with what i'm going 
through 
now my kite string snapped
 drifting into the blue

man what could I even 
do
i looked, but never found a
clue
opportunities which i always 
threw
away what could im-prove
this never - mov-
ing image that kills my inner
kid that's just the beginner
who didn't know the line got thinner
as he got older and became a sinner
now he will never be a winner
'cause his demons sit at dinner 
always ready hitting the trigger
and it made me a soulless figure

and now i'm trapped
forced to go to the bad
path that made me fed
up with all the good
and it's messing with my mood
it's impossible to find real truth
------------------------------

DATE: 23/12/2025
LYRICS:
it's hard for me to not interrupt
get lost in my thoughts when they loud
like a volcano waiting to erupt
getting burned by every violence
getting hurt by every silence
while i yearned for every defiance
that I

want when I'm mad 
at myself, now and the past
i'm so deep i need the words of the dark 
the words that cut deep and I know that'll last 
making sure that i'll prevent my own ignited spark

but at last, it doesn't matter
i fought so hard, just to end up not getting better
now i'm done, i gave up 
the dark part won, and i end with my empty cup
------------------------------

LYRICS:
It's hard to interpret
If the voices are friends
Or are they really the culprit

Am I the lighthouse beam cutting through the fog of war
Or am i really the reason that the war has a start

LYRICS:
Every day i wake up in search for an interest
Looking for a place to put my hope
But never finding a right place to invest

Try to put it into writing
But i'll never be at rest
Every day my thoughts get so loud
But i try not to let
It rain down from it's cloud
Follow the spark of an idea
In a forest full of doubt
Tryna get through the sea
But it's a constant battle throughout
------------------------------
