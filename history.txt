WORD: INTEREST
LYRICS:
Every day I wake up in search for an interest
Looking for a place to put my hope
But never finding a right place to invest

Try to put it into writing
But I'll never be at rest
Every day my thoughts get so loud
But I try not to let
It rain down from it's cloud
Follow the spark of an idea
In a forest full of doubt
Tryna get through the sea
But it's a constant battle throughout
